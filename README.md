Looking for more comfortable way how to monitor your glucose levels? If you have a Samsung WearOS smart watch then this is the ideal app for you!

G-Watch Wear App is a bridge between your CGM app and your Samsung WearOS watch. It collects glucose values provided by 3rd party CGM applications (Glimp, XDrip+, DiaBox, AndroidAPS, NightScout, Dexcom Share, etc...) and sends collected data to the watch. G-Watch watch faces then display received values to its user.


This is the first release of G-Watch App for WearOS watch models. It is primary focused on Glaxy Watch 4 models as a direct successor of previous TizenOS Galaxy models where the original G-Watch App was used.

The list of supported features for this release:
- 2 configurable watch faces Digital and Analog.
- collection of backgrounds and watch hands
- BG alarms with vibrations and sounds configurable on the watch
- configurable appearance of components on the watch
- customizable BG graph
- 3rd party complications support.
- adjustable BG thresholds from thr mobile app

- integrated BG values complication provider for other watch faces
- phone app widget with current BG value, trend, BG graph and data source indicator

The list will grow with the next releases.
